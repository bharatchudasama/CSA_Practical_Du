> The & (bitwise AND) in C++ takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every bit of two numbers. The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1.  
> The | (bitwise OR) in C++ takes two numbers as operands and does OR on every bit of two numbers. The result of OR is 1 if any of the two bits is 1. 

> The ^ (bitwise XOR) in C++ takes two numbers as operands and does XOR on every bit of two numbers. The result of XOR is 1 if the two bits are different.
