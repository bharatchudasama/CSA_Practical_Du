1) Write a program to convert an unsigned number in one radix ‘A’ to the
equivalent number in another radix ‘B’, where A and B can be any
positive integer.
2) Write a program that will prompt for the input of two integer values.
Then using the Bitwise shift operators show the result of
a. Left shifting the first number by the second
b. Right shifting the first number by the second
3) Write a program that will prompt for the input of two integer values.
Then using the logical operators show the result of
a. Exclusive OR of the first number by the second bitwise
b. OR of the first number by the second bitwise
c. AND of the first number by the second bitwise
4) Write a program that will prompt for the input of a binary value and print
a. One’s complement
b. Two’s complement
5) Write a program to print the values of a 5 bit binary up-down counter.
User should be able to specify the up or down nature of the counter.
6) Write a program to implement bit-wise addition of two numbers.
7) Write a program to implement bit-wise Subtraction of two numbers using
2’s complement.
8) Write a program to implement Selective Set logical operation using bitwise operators.
9) Write a program to implement Selective Complement logical operation
using bit-wise operators.
10) Write a program to implement Selective Clear logical operation using bitwise operators.
