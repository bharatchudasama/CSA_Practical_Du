To subtract b from a. Write the expression (a-b) as:  

(a - b) = a + (-b)

Now (-b) can be written as (2’s complement of b). So the above expression can be now written as:  

(a - b) = a + (2's complement of b)
So, the problem now reduces to “Add a to the 2’s complement of b“. The below image illustrates the above method of subtraction for the first example where a = 2 and b = 3.
