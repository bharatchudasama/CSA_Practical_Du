# first approach 
to solve the problem would be to first convert the given number into its binary representation and then change every 1’s to 0 and 0’s to 1.
After changing all 0’s and 1’s convert the binary representation to number.
# second Approach 
1. Find the number of bits in the given integer 
2. XOR the given integer with 2^number_of_bits-1
